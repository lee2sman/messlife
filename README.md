# About

Messlife is a virtual DIY warehouse for art, music, collaboration. A Temporary Autonomous Zone of the sky.

This repo contains the working Unity files for building Messlife.

There is a separate repo for [Messcafe](https://github.com/lee2sman/MESSCAFE). Messcafe is the website and tracking pages for building, discussing and contributing to the construction of the Messlife space.

Anyone can contribute to the Messlife artspace. If you are excited about buildign the physical (virtual) artspace, please get in touch here or on the Messcafe site or repo.

Once opened, Messlife will exist as a space for events like a studio-workshop, talks, parties, concerts, etc. It's an open-ended DIY virtual artspace.

# Technical

Messlife is built in Unity/C#, built as WebGL to run in browser. Use firefox or run on a server. Current version is 0.5. 

# Goals
* Ability to upload a file and have it output as 3d mesh object
* Ability to move around uploaded images to build 3d objects
* DJ station (ability to stream audio when in station)
* No permanent delete. Instead, removing a built panel places it in a permanent, growing trashpile.
* Ability to take a photo and assign it to an event. Events get published to Messcafe page so you can jump to an event and see documentation.
* SERVER!

# Questions
* Do we need avatars? Simple Hands or Pointers or Smileys instead, maybe with ability to upload image?
*
